This code is based on a PluralSight course by Janani Ravi.
The idea is to experiment with the Harris corner detection algorithm.

If interest in additional comments, I invite you to read the
follwoing post in my blog:

Keep in mid that one of the best ways to lear is to read, 
experiment, and repeat as needed.

Enjoy;
